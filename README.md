# tiffany's portfolio site

my personal site, updated march 2021.

## about

after going down a rabbit hole of so many amazing portfolios, i wanted to make my newest revamp a little more fun than just a list of things I've done.

## process

the site was built in [react.js](https://reactjs.org/) and designed in [figma](https://www.figma.com/).

i used [aos.js](https://michalsnik.github.io/aos/) for scroll animations, [framer motion api](https://www.framer.com/api/motion/) for animations, [react-icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/) and [remix icon library](https://remixicon.com/) for icons, [material ui](https://material-ui.com/) for theming and styling, and [heebo](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Heebo) and [corben](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Corben) as fonts.
