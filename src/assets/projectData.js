        <Typography variant="body2">A digital journal and mood tracker chrome extension.<br /><br />Choose from coffee roasts to match your mood, save journal entries, and interact with a mood calendar that grows a little bit every day. Saves data locally. Works offline. Add sugar to taste.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="h2">why</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">I started thinking more about journaling last year ‚Äî specifically, bullet journaling. But even though I could stare at bullet journal spreads for hours, I doubted I had the time, energy, or handwriting skills to pull it off. I wanted a way to maintain a layout digitally and update it in seconds.</Typography>

        <Typography variant="h2">what</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">From the first time that day you open the extension, you're greeted with 5 options to rate how your day‚Äôs going ‚Äî "amazing" to "stressed" ‚Äî plus a small area to write down any thoughts and select a theme.<br /><br />The calendar itself is a grid populated with every day of the year, with the day's color being whatever mood was previously chosen for that day. These aren't static ‚Äî you can click on a day at any time to cycle through and reinput moods. You can also read, edit, and delete any journal entries made through hovering and ‚Äúlocking‚Äù (right clicking) any given day.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="h2">how</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">Although I‚Äôm more of a tea person, I love the idea of starting your day in a warm, sunlit cafe with a cup of coffee.

        <Typography variant="body2">From various Flash games to Mountains Studio‚Äôs ‚ÄúFlorence‚Äù, I love stories told through a sequence of quick, light-hearted minigames. I wanted to make one of my own, inspired by the tone and aesthetic of lifestyle vloggers.</Typography>

        <Typography variant="body2">I wanted to reinforce themes of self-care and relaxation, so none of the minigames are timed, there‚Äôs lots of jokes and easter eggs throughout, and the game is easily completable in one sitting. The art and animation, drawn in Paint Tool SAI, were made to create a warmer, livelier version of reality. The game was built in Unity and C#. I used libraries like TMPro for text, LeanTween for animations, 2DxFx for visual effects, and Legendxh‚Äôs Snap-To-Grid for the base of the last minigame.</Typography>

        <Typography variant="h2">why</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">I‚Äôm a big fan of boba. But it was rare, and on the off-chance I traveled far enough away from my small town to get some, I began noticing something: when I finished my drink, sometimes there‚Äôd be a handful of tapioca pearls left, dry, at the bottom of the cup. It felt like such a waste.<br /><br />So, I translated that experience and my love of boba into a puzzle game where your objective is to sip up as many pearls as possible before your drink runs out. It features a lot of order customization options, as per any boba shop.</Typography>
        <img src={boba_pic2} style={large} alt="boba's main screen, puzzle screen, and boba shop customization screen"></img>
        <Typography variant="h2">what</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">The puzzle itself is similar to Minesweeper with a twist: there‚Äôs 3 dimensions. Once the game starts, square grids are layered on top of each other, where every cell on each layer is randomized to either a topping or empty. The game is top-view, so only the top layer is completely visible and interactable ‚Äî after all, you can only drink a drink from the top. Every time you tap a cell to‚Äúsip‚Äù, that cell will be removed and replaced by the cell on the layer right underneath. Your score and amount of drink left will then be affected accordingly.<br/><br/>Now, for the strategy: any cells that don‚Äôt contain a topping will contain, instead, a number. That number counts up however many toppings are nearby, like Minesweeper, but with the bombs being what you want to press. The 3rd dimension twist is that ‚Äúnearby‚Äù means checking, not the top, but the grid right underneath the top, where the number just checks for toppings directly below the cell and directly below any cross-neighboring cell areas. So, whenever there‚Äôs a cross (or plus) of 1s, that means a topping can be found right underneath the middle ‚Äî the cross marks the spot ‚Äî and any higher numbers indicate overlapping crosses of 1s. As you have a limited amount of drink, you need to examine each number closely to see what your best move could be.<br/><br/>The game can becomes more challenging and complex with larger sizes, which can be selected alongside flavor (grid theme) and topping (pearl theme) before every game. You can also customize your boba cup as you‚Äôd like in a separate menu.</Typography>

        <Typography variant="body2">A slot machine tied both to your childhood and your heart.<br /><br />From enduring a stressful home life to enjoying the luxuries of a well-off family, your slots decide what your childhood is like and what the current physical consequences will be. Try your hand at your slot machine and see where you end up!</Typography>
        <Typography variant="h2">why</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">You can‚Äôt help where, when, or how you grow up. From a stressful home life to a high-income household, the factors that define our childhood are a lottery ‚Äî out of our control. I created ‚ÄúCardioCasino‚Äù, a life-simulator game, to interpret this phenomena as well as its effect on increasing risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. The basis of the game is from Cleveland Clinic sourced research.</Typography>
        <img src={cardiocasino_pic2} style={large} alt="story drawings and text appear ontop of the slot machine"></img>
        <Typography variant="h2">what</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">In the game, you interact with the virtual slot machine by clicking the button in the middle. It rolls through a variety of slot options. To represent the link to physical consequences, any red slots, negative psychosocial factors, will lower the heart health meter at the top right and green slots, positive psychosocial factors, will raise it. If you get 2 or more of the same slot, you‚Äôll be greeted with a childhood memory that corresponds to the slot--for example, if you get a red house you‚Äôll have experienced your parents fighting. The memory is interactable to an extent, as you can choose dialogue or things like whether to ‚Äúwalk‚Äù or ‚Äúrun‚Äù, but any actions will still lead to the same result and effect on your heart health. This illusion of choice emphasizes the lottery nature of our childhood. With every memory, you‚Äôll also see a memento from that memory appear at the bottom.<br /><br />Once your meter hits 0, you‚Äôre given the chance to start over, but you‚Äôll notice the mementos stay put throughout runs. Eventually, players will be able to collect all 8. This sends the player to the true ending: you discover that, although your slot machine results may be fated, maybe others‚Äô aren‚Äôt.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="h2">how</Typography>
        <Typography variant="body2">The heart-themed, overgrown slot machine was first drawn on pen and paper, then finalized digitally in Paint Tool SAI. Icons were taken and modified from various artists in the Noun Project. Font is my own handwriting generated using Calligraphr. The game was built in Unity and C# and uses ink to create dialogue.<br /><br />A few scenarios in the ‚Äòflashback‚Äô scenes were conceptually inspired by real people‚Äôs stories. While working on this game, I opened up an anonymous Google Form where people online could share their stories relating to one or more of the psychosocial factors I chose. They‚Äôre sensitive topics, many of which I haven‚Äôt experienced first-hand, so I wanted to put a lot of care and effort in understanding and portraying them. I incorporated 20 people‚Äôs stories.</Typography>
